PLEASE NOTE I THE FILES TITLED COPY1 WERE ALL COPY AND PASTED! PLEASE DO NOT AWARD ME ANY EXTRA CREDIT FOR THE WORK I COPIED!. I am just adding them in for fun., cause i wanted to see how html css and java piece together to make something like this. Plus now you guys also get a customizeable Currency Converter that looks pretty nice.

The numbers are a bit off, but thats just cause I copied and pasted. I don't know how accurate it is to the actual currency in all honesty however the math appears close enough to me to be honest. 

I'm curious as to how we can possibly add the values of the currency in real time, since I guess its always changing? I see people doing things like that in python with api keys to certain websites. However I am unsure as to how we can add python into our html,css,and java, if thats even possible. 

enclosed in the extra credit file is two files. One file with my work. 

And one file with work that was, copied, pasted, and tested. Ready to get added into someones webpage.
